-------------------------------------------------------
Finds best opponent by combining IRT (theta/beta), DDA adjustments, and consistency.

Flow: 1) Identify cluster 2) Recompute IRT 3) Apply DDA 4) Search cluster 5) Fallback 6) Calculate score
Features: Adaptive weighting, cross-cluster fallback, IRT/DDA integration
